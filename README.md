### By: Dimple Sharma

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How to design and implement a real-world SQL project
- Creating and managing databases with multiple tables (`Books`, `Customers`, and `Orders`)
- Writing both **basic** and **advanced** SQL queries to extract meaningful insights
- Using **JOINS**, **aggregations**, **CTEs**, **window functions**, and **subqueries**
- Enhancing SQL analysis with **data visualizations**

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **MS Excel** – Data preparation  
- **pgAdmin4** – PostgreSQL management and query execution

---

## 🗃️ Database Tables

- **Books**
- **Customers**
- **Orders**

## 🔍 Part 1: Basic SQL Queries

Examples of basic queries:

- Retrieve all books in the "Fiction" genre
- Find books published after 1950
- List all customers from Canada
- Show orders placed in November 2023
- Get the total stock of books available
- Find the most expensive books
- Identify customers who ordered more than one book
- Calculate total revenue generated

> ✅ These queries help build a foundational understanding of SQL syntax and filtering data with WHERE clauses.

## 🚀 Part 2: Advanced SQL Queries

Examples of advanced queries:

- Total number of books sold per genre
- Average book price by genre
- Customers with at least two orders
- Most frequently ordered book
- Top 3 expensive books in the "Fantasy" genre
- Total quantity sold per author
- Cities of high-spending customers
- Customer with highest spend
- Stock remaining after all orders

> 🔍 This section focuses on analytical techniques using **GROUP BY**, **JOINs**, **aggregates**, and **filtering logic**.

## 📊 Graph Visualizations

- Total books sold by Fiction type
- Stock of top 3 expensive books
- Price variation by genre & stock levels
- Remaining stock after order fulfillment

> 📈 Visualized insights for better storytelling and decision-making.
